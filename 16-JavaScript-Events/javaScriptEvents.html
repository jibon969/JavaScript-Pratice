        HTML Events

            An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
            Here are some examples of HTML events:
            
            An HTML web page has finished loading
            An HTML input field was changed
            An HTML button was clicked
        -->

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>
        <p id="demo"></p>

        <!-- Example -->
        <h4>JavaScript HTML Events</h4>
        <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>
        <br>

        <!-- Example -->
        <button id="demo2" onclick="displayDate()">Click me</button>

        <script>
            function displayDate(){
                document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = Date();
            }
        </script>
